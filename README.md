the way to compile testfile.

./comp (0) >> imem.h

sh make.sh

./out


testj File is to count from 10 to 0 in a loop and stop the programm.
testMem is writing in a place of memory from one register and load it back to another register.
testmult is multiplig register 1 and 2 and load it to register 3.
